## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Always Target `main`**: All feature branches and pull requests must branch from and target `main` (never `master`).
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Swift 6 Concurrency & Architecture**:
   - Comply strictly with Swift 6 Concurrency rules (Strict Concurrency Checking).
   - Keep public API surfaces clean, well-documented with DocC comments, and modular.
   - Maintain zero unnecessary dependencies.

3. **Testing**:
   - Any new functionality or bugfix must include corresponding automated tests (`swift test`).
   - Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting a PR.
4. **Commit Conventions**:
   - Follow Conventional Commits (`feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`, `test: ...`).
5. **Submitting a Pull Request**:
   - Push your branch to your fork and submit a PR targeting `main`.
   - Include a concise explanation of changes and verification steps.
